# Band Name Maker
A Python script for generating unique band names with user input.

## Sample Outputs

![sample output 1]() ![sample output 2]()

## User Story
As a user, I need help thinking of a name for my band. I want a program that will gather my name and other information from me then use that information to generate band names. The program should be flexible and unpredictable with what it outputs, but I also want it to follow certain band naming conventions.

## How to Run
You will need Python downloaded to your computer to run this, as well as creating a fork and pulling the repository to your local device. Alternatively, you could copy the content of the `band_name_maker.py` file and paste it to any empty file of the same name on your local device and run that from your Python interpreter. There are no dependencies or additional files to run.
